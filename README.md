# Juby

After spending far too long to figure out some memory problems, this project will be retired for a new, updated version coming soon!

A programming language

## Y Lisp

Y Lisp is the language of the Juby runtime, which is what Juby gets
compiled down into. Examples of it can be seen in the examples directory.

## Building

Building is very easy. `make` is all it takes.
You can then invoke a REPL session.

Alternatively, you can run a file the the `-y` flag, so for example

    ./juby.out -y examples/person.y
